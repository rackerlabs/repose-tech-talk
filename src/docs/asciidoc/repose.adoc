== Demo Time

[%step]
Are you ready for it?

[%step]
Are you sure? Because this is going to blow your mind.

[%step]
Last chance to leave.

[%step]
Let's do this.

== Passthrough Example

* This configuration is questionably useful.
* All it really does is take requests on one port and send them out on another.
* Let's us know that *Repose* is installed correctly.

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8080
----

tag: `passthrough`

== Http Logging Example

* Records details about the request/response in a separate log.
* No really, that's it.

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8080
----

tag: `http-log`
